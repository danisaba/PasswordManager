# PasswordManager
This is a password manager that has the ability to save passwords for whatever you need, create a random 16/32 character password with the option to include special characters,
modify existing passwords, and list out the saved passwords. 

Currently, passwords are not saved across runs, but that is a feature I plan to implement in the future. 

To run this program, download VSCode onto your computer, download rust in vscode through the extensions market, and if you are on linux you will want cargo so that you can run it by cd-ing into the src file and using "cargo run".
If you are on Windows, download rust in VSCode, and also download the Code Runner extension. Then cd into the src file and you should be able to use cargo run.

When you cd into the src file, the thing inside should be main.rs. So typing "cargo run" into the terminal will run main. If you use it anywhere else outside of the src folder it may not work.
